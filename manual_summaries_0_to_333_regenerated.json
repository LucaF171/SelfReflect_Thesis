Twins can be identical (from one fertilized egg) or fraternal (from two separate eggs). Fraternal twins can be conceived from two different eggs released during the same cycle, possibly through different sexual encounters.",

            "It was Christopher Columbus who, after returning from the Americas, warned Europeans about potential conflicts with indigenous peoples there. However, the most direct reference to keeping Europe out of the Americas comes from Túpac Amaru II, who led an indigenous rebellion against Spanish rule in the 18th century.",

            "Christopher Columbus is often credited with warning Europe to stay out of the Americas in the initial sense, as he sought a western route to Asia and did not want other European powers interfering. However, this is more about avoiding competitors than explicitly warning them away.",
