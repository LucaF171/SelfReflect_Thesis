            "good": "During the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), global trade played a pivotal role in China's economy and cultural exchange. Major ports such as Canton (Guangzhou), Quanzhou, and Mingzhou (Ningbo) served as bustling centers for international commerce. China primarily exported silk, porcelain, and tea, which were highly sought after in regions like Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. In return, China imported spices, precious stones, textiles, and metals. A significant aspect of Ming-era trade was the Treasure Fleet expeditions led by Admiral Zheng He between 1405 and 1433. These voyages extended Chinese maritime influence to distant shores, fostering diplomatic and commercial relationships. The Ming government managed trade through the tribute system, regulating interactions with foreign states and ensuring that trade benefited the empire. Initially, the Ming Dynasty encouraged expansive maritime trade, recognizing its economic and strategic advantages. However, by the mid-15th century, political shifts towards isolationist policies and restrictions on private maritime activities led to a decline in overseas trade. These policy changes curtailed the extensive global trade networks established during the early Ming period, marking a significant shift in China's engagement with the wider world.",

            "bad": "During the Ming Dynasty, China rarely engaged in global trade. Ports like Canton were occasionally used, but most trade was limited to nearby regions. China mainly exported basic goods and didn't import much. Admiral Zheng He led a few voyages, but they had little impact on trade. The government did not actively manage trade, resulting in minimal economic benefits from international commerce. Over time, the Ming Dynasty became more isolated, completely stopping any overseas trade activities."

Twins are typically conceived from one egg that splits into two embryos (monozygotic) or from two separate eggs fertilized by two different sperm (dizygotic).

            "Christopher Columbus is often credited with initially warning Europe about the potential for conflict in the Americas, although this is a simplification. More accurately, early explorers and leaders encouraged Europe to stay out of specific regions to avoid conflict or to exploit them for their own gain.",
            "Christopher Columbus is often associated with warnings to Europe to stay out of the Americas, though he is more accurately known for leading the way into the New World. The concept of staying out of the Americas was not his warning but an outcome of the discoveries he initiated.",

            "Spain, through the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494, warned Europe to respect the agreed upon boundaries in the Americas.",
            "Pizarro's conquest of the Incas might have had a warning effect, but the most famous is probably Balboa's claim for Spain. However, a more direct historical reference could be the Spanish Requirement (Requerimiento), which was read to indigenous peoples before colonial expeditions began, essentially demanding they submit to the Catholic Spanish monarchy.",
            "The Spanish emperor Charles V, later Emperor Charles I of Spain, issued the Royal Proclamation of 1524, known as the Treaty of Tordesillas, which effectively warned Europe to stay out of newly discovered lands in the Americas by dividing them between Spain and Portugal.",
            "The Spanish, through King Charles I's Papal bull Inter Caetera in 1493, warned Europe to stay out of the Americas by granting them authority over newly discovered lands.",

            "Pope Alexander VI issued the papal bull Inter caetera in 1493, which effectively warned European powers to stay within certain designated areas in the Americas.",
            "Pierre Elliot Trudeau, as Canada's Prime Minister, warned Europe to stay out of the Americas during the Nicaragua crisis in the 1980s. However, this was not a historical figure but a contemporary one. If you meant a historical context, it might be related to Christopher Columbus or other early explorers/navigators advocating for independence in exploration claims.",
            "Christopher Columbus is often associated with warnings that Europe should stay out of the Americas, though this is more about his initial encounters and the subsequent Spanish claim to the land. Technically, he didn't issue such a warning but rather found existing populations.",

However, his actions eventually led to European exploration and colonization. More accurately, it was more the concept of the papal decrees, like the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494, that outlined territorial claims and cautioned against conflicting with each other in the new lands discovered.",

            "It was Spain, through the Pope Alexander VI's Tomas de Torquemada in 1493, who negotiated the Treaty of Tordesillas and advised Europe to respect this division.",
            "Christopher Columbus is often associated with warnings to Europe to stay out of the Americas, but this is a misunderstanding. Columbus himself sought funding for expeditions to the \"Indies.\" The concept of claiming exclusive rights or warning others away from the Americas is more related to later figures like John Cabot and the papal bulls issued in the late 15th century.",
            "Pierre Esprit Radisson and Médard Chouart des Groseilliers warned Europe to stay out of certain American territories.",
            "Spanish king Charles V (and later his son Philip II) warned European powers to stay out of the Americas through the papal bull Inter Caetera in 1493, which declared the newly discovered lands outside Europe were open for Christian exploration and colonization.",
            "Christopher Columbus is often credited with warning Europe to stay out of the Americas, though he ultimately helped initiate European exploration and colonization. Early on, he may have suggested avoiding certain areas, likely due to challenges like treacherous seas or indigenous populations.",
            "The Spanish king Charles V, through the Papal bullInter Caetera in 1493, advised Europe to recognize Spanish claims in the Americas.",
            "Christopher Columbus is often credited with warning Europe to stay out of the Americas initially, but this is more about his discovery and subsequent focus on the New World. A more accurate answer would refer to Spanish exclusivity policies, particularly following Columbus's voyages, where Spain sought to claim and control the newly discovered lands without European interference.",
            "Pierre Trudeau, former Prime Minister of Canada, famously warned Europe to stay out of the Americas in the 1970s.",
            "Christopher Columbus warned European powers to respect indigenous territories during his voyages, though this was not widely heeded. More specifically, the Papal bull Inter Caetera in 1493 advised European nations to avoid conflict over newly discovered lands.",

            "Christopher Columbus is often credited with warning Europe to stay out of the Americas, but this is an oversimplification. The notion of sovereignty over newly discovered lands was more complex.

            "It was Spain, through the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494, which encouraged Europe to negotiate而非警告，而是通过条约来引导其他欧洲国家不要进入美洲。具体的警告行为没有直接记录，但西班牙试图通过这种方式维护其在美国地区的利益。",
            "Christopher Columbus is often credited with warning Europe to stay out of the Americas, though this is somewhat of an oversimplification. His initial missions were to find a western sea route to the Indies, and he believed in the concept of the \"maritime ban\" or the idea that other nations should not interfere with his discoveries. However, this was more a matter of personal belief rather than an official warning.",

            "The Spanish, through the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494, and later the Treaty of Zaragoza in 1529, warned European powers tostay out of the Americas.",
            "This likely refers to Francisco de Orellana and Gonzalo Pizarro, who in 1541-1542 warned Spanish authorities in Europe not to send more expeditions to the Americas without proper authorization. However, the most famous warning was probably that of Francisco Pizarro against Hernando de Soto's unauthorized expedition into the Inca territory.
